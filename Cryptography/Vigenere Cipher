Question:
The vignere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.<br />
Iâ€™m not sure what this means, but it was left lying around: blorpy
gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}


Logic:
Its pretty obvious that the gibberish given is encoded using Vigenere Cipher. 
They have also given a string "blorpy". This could be the key.


Steps:
1- Head over to CyberChef and select the 'Vigenere Cipher' tool
2- Give the input as the cipher given in the question and key as the given string "blorpy"
3- When you see the output, you will get your flag!



Flag: flag{CiphersAreAwesome}

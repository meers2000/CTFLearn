Question: 
One of the easiest and earliest known ciphers but with XXI century twist! Nobody uses Alphabet nowadays right? Why should you when you have your keyboard?

Logic:
The greatest hint is "Why should you use your keyboard?" This hints us that it could be something to do with our keyboard. It also says 'right'.
This could mean, it is Keyboard shift cipher with right direction!


Steps:
1- Look at each character of the given gibberish.
2- For eg. lets take the first character 'B'. 2 shifts left of B is 'C' on the keyboard.
3- Write down this 'C' separately and continue doing this for rest of the characters.
4- When you put it all together, you have your flag!

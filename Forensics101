Question:
Think the flag is somewhere in there. Would you help me find it? https://mega.nz/#!OHohCbTa!wbg60PARf4u6E6juuvK9-aDRe_bgEL937VO01EImM7c


Logic:
They have given an image and clearly said the flag is hidden in it.
We know that it belongs to the Forensics category, hence the easiest thing to do is first open it with your text editor and see what happens.

Steps:
1- Download the given image.
2- Open it with text editor/Notepad+ etc.
3- Search for the word "Flag"
4- You have your flag!

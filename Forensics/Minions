Question: 
Hey! Minions have stolen my flag, encoded it few times in one cipher, and then hidden it somewhere there: 
https://mega.nz/file/1UBViYgD#kjKISs9pUB4E-1d79166FeX3TiY5VQcHJ_GrcMbaLhg Can you help me? TIP: Decode the flag until you got a sentence.






Steps:
1. Go to the given URL and download the image. (Hey_You.png)
2. Open your command prompt and use the command 'strings Hey_You.png'.
3. You will get another link, open that and download the next image. (Only_Few_Steps)
4. Use the binwalk command on this image to search for any hidden files => binwalk --extract --dd=".*." Only_Few_Steps.jpg
5. Now you will get another image. Use the strings command on it.
6. Now you have a flag but looks like it is of base 64. So now we need to extract it. (repeatedly because they have mentioned so in the question)
7. Go over to CyberChef and input this string. 
8. Decode it repeatedly using 'base64'.
9. You have your flag!





Flag: CTF{M1NI0NS_ARE_C00L}

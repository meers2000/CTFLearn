Question: 
Just take the Ls. Check out this zip file and I be the flag will remain hidden. https://mega.nz/#!mCgBjZgB!_FtmAm8s_mpsHr7KWv8GYUzhbThNn0I8cHMBi4fJQp8


Logic:
They have told to check the zip file out. Once we open it, we can get a lead.



Steps:
1- Download the zip file. You will see a PDF named "Flag" and one document name "password"
2- For opening the flag pdf, they require a password. So obviously we will go to the password document.
3- Take the password from that document and input it as the password in the PDF file.
4- You have unlocked your flag!

Question: 
The flag used to be there. But then I redacted it. 
Good Luck. https://mega.nz/#!3CwDFZpJ!Jjr55hfJQJ5-jspnyrnVtqBkMHGJrd6Nn_QqM7iXEuc



Logic-
The name of the challenge itself is 'Git....'. So we can first download the zip file and maybe try using different git commands on it.




Steps: 
1. Go to the given link and download the zip folder
2. Unzip the folder 
3. Go over to your command prompt and write the command 'git log -u'
4. You have your flag!

Note:
There are many other commands as well which you can use to get the flag.




Flag: flag{protect_your_git}

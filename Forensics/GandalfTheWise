Question: 
Extract the flag from the Gandalf.jpg file. You may need to write a quick script to solve this.


Steps:

1- We can see a "JPG" image. Head over to your Linux command promopt.
2- Use the "file <imagename>" command to see details.
3- You can see 3 comments in the output in base64 format.
4- Lets decode these commands and see what we get.

Comment 1: Q1RGbGVhcm57eG9yX2lzX2lvdXJfZnJpZW5kfQo
After decoding with base64: CTFlearn{xor_is_iour_friend}

You got a flag! But this is not the correct flag. 
If its not the correct flag, it could be a hint!

5- It says 'XOR' is your friend. This could mean we need to XOR something. But what? You can see 2 more comments. Maybe it is something to do with that!
6- Decode the remaining 2 comments using base64.

String 1: xD6kfO2UrE5SnLQ6WgESK4kvD/Y/rDJPXNU45k/p
O/P after decoding with base64: Ä>¤|í.¬NR.´:Z..+./.ö?¬2O\Õ8æOé

String 2: h2riEIj13iAp29VUPmB+TadtZppdw3AuO7JRiDyU
O/P after decoding with base64: .jâ..õÞ )ÛÕT>`~M§mf.]Ãp.;²Q.<.

7- Now you have 2 strings. XOR them. You can do this using a tiny script:

string1 = ""
string2 = ""
a = string1
A = base64.b64decode(a)
b = string2
B = base64.b64decode(b)
c = []
l = len(A)
i = 0
while i < l:
  c.append(chr(A[i] ^ B[i]))
  i += 1
print(c)

8- You now have your required flag!


Flag: CTFlearn{Gandalf.BilboBaggins}

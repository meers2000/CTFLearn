Question:
The keyword is hexadecimal, and removing an useless H.E.H.U.H.E. from the flag. The flag is in the format CTFlearn{*}


Logic-
We have to somehow extract the file, and then remove the "H"'s from the flag. There are several ways to do this.


Steps-
1- Go over to your linux command prompt.
2- Use the command "strings" to extract the strings from the file. [ strings file ]
3- You will see a list of extracted strings. Scroll until you find the flag.
4- They have told in the questions the remove H so we'll remove all the H's.
5- You now have your final flag!


Flag: CTFlearn{fl4ggyfl4g}

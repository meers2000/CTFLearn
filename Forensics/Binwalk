Question: 
Here is a file with another file hidden inside it. 
Can you extract it? https://mega.nz/#!qbpUTYiK!-deNdQJxsQS8bTSMxeUOtpEclCI-zpK7tbJiKV0tXYY


Logic:
First find out the image type and details. You'll see that this is actually a PNG image and has another PNG image hidden in it.
Now we have to extract that hidden image.


Steps:
1- To find out the hidden file, use the binwalk command.
 "binwalk -e <imagename>"  [-e for extract]
2- Now, to extract all the files we can use the command:
 "binwalk --extract --dd=".*" <image name>" [Extracts type signatures, give the files an extension of ext, and executes cmd]
3- You will see the extracted folder (either on desktop or in whichever directory you had your image)
4- Open the image in this extracted folder and you have your flag!

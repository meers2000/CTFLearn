Question:
Hi, I'm Noxtal! I have hidden a flag somewhere in my Cyberworld (AKA blog)... you may find a good application for your memory. ;)
Note: This is my real website (thus no deadly bug to exploit here). You might want to read some of my content (writeups, tutorials, and cheatsheets). I would be glad to receive any kind of feedback.
Click here to access it, have fun checking my blog out! Cheers!
Hint: replace the flag{} part with CTFlearn{}.



Logic- 
The main hint is "application" ..... "memory". Since its a web challenge, we can go to the given url and check the developer tools and see if we get some lead.



Steps:
1. Go to the given blog URL
2. Open the developer tools of that web page.
3. Under the application column, you'll find different storages.
4. Open the local storage and search for the storage of noxtal.
5. You will see the key "flag" and its given is your flag!




Flag: CTFLearn{n7f_l0c4l_570r463_15n7_53cur3_570r463}

Question: 
See if you can leak the whole database. 
The flag is in there somwhere: 
https://web.ctflearn.com/web4/


Logic: 
When we go over to the given URL, we find an input bar that requires something as input. We can guess that after clicking submit, we can get our flag.
By typing any nonsense, you dont get the output. The name is "Injection", so maybe we can try basic injection commands.



Steps:
1- Go to the given URL

2- Type the following in the input bar:
' OR '1' = '1'
Reason: This command is designed to pull up the records of the specified username from its table of users. 
The output of < ' OR '1' > will always give output 1 and hence is true. If its true, it identifies us as authentic and gives us access to the records.
So by injecting this, we will always get access to the database.


3- Click on the submit button

4- When you look at the output, you will spot the flag!



Flag: CTF{fl4g__giv3r}

Question: 
Hello! My friend Fari send me this suspecious message: 'MQDzqdor{Ix4Oa41W_1F_B00h_m1YlqPpPP}' and photo.png. Help me decrypt this!


Logic:
We have been given 2 things.
1- The PNG format image.
2- An encrypted message.
If you look carefully, "Fari" gives you the hint "Fair". What ciphers do you know of having the word "Fair" in it?
PLayfair cipher will come to your mind! 


Steps:
1- Take the suspicious message and decrypt it using playfair cipher.
2- You have been given a key to decrypt this. Where you ask? In the image.
3- Type out all the alphabets given in the image: "QWERTYUIO....". This is your key!
4- You get your flag after decryption!

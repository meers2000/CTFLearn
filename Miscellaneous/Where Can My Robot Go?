Question:
Where do robots find what pages are on a website?
Hint:
What does disallow tell a robot?


Logic:
It says about "robots" on a webpage. Maybe we can find the robots.txt page of CTFLearn and find for some hidden clue.



Steps:
1- Search for the robots.txt page of CTFLearn. The URL will be:
https://ctflearn.com/robots.txt

2- You can see "Disallow: /70r3hnanldfspufdsoifnlds.html". 
This now gives us some lead.

3- Try out entering the string in "Disallow" at the end of the URL.
-> https://ctflearn.com/70r3hnanldfspufdsoifnlds.html

4- You now have your flag!
